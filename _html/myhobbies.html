			<h1>My Favorite Hobbies</h1>
			<p>I like to stay active and try to keep in shape, so I always try to do outdoorsy stuff. I hope you see the passion in what I do because you will notice that these hobbies require dedication and consistency! </p>
			<p>This goes without saying that these interests allowed me to travel to many places, explore a variety of authentic foods, and meet many wonderful people that share the same interest and outlook on life. I have to say that I consider myself fortunate to practice these hobbies.</p>

			<h2>This is what I like to do</h2>

			<h3>Flying airplanes</h3> 
			<p><img class="align-left" src="/_images/FlyOverIE.JPG" width="329" height="387" alt="Fly Inland Empire" /></p>

			<p style="margin-right: 210px">This is me flying over Ontario, CA. I was flying at about 6,000 feet and watching a beautiful sunrise over snowy Mount Baldy. I alway enjoy flying early in the morning because I get to watch very scenic views and beautiful skys. Until this day I cannot believe that I am able to do such things. This is just one example of the beauty of flying that you will experience. you will find many rewarding views. Leave me a feedback if you interested in taking a flight with me for a photo tour or just a joy flight or even go get a $100 burger!</p>

			<p>Please Visit my feedback page or stop by my home page to learn about the many exciting adventures you can join. We can plan a tour of an adventurous flight.</p>

			<h3>Practice martial arts</h3> 
			<p><img class="align-right" src="/_images/RivKarate.jpg" width="329" height="389" alt="Karate" /></p> 

			<p>I started learning martial arts at the age of eight and I've never stopped since. I hold the rank of a black belt third degree in Shotokan Karate Do, one of the oldest Okinawan martial arts forms. My first black belt was awarded to me by Sensei Kaze, One of the four grand masters of this art. I once was part of a national team of Karate, and I participed in many international competition including the World championship of Karate. Now days, I do not practice heavely like I used to, but I keep a healthy balance and get in my Gee at least once a week.</p> 

			<p>One thing that highlights my karate career is my suspension from the art twice by the governing federation and also, for political reasons my black belt was stripped from me by the Local fedearation, but I recovered all back thanks to the support of very kind and wonderful people in the art.</p>

			<h3>Windsurf in cool places</h3> 
			<p><img class="align-left" src="/_images/WinMntView.JPG" width="329" height="389" alt="Windsurf" /></p>

			<p style="margin-right: 200px">windsurfing is another hobby that I picked up at a young age and stayed with me until this day. It is one of those highly addictive activity. once you learn it and get to a certain level of mastery, you will never stop. there is an element of thrill to it. I had the opportunity to windsurf in Australia, Hawai, Tenerif, and many other exautic places. Highly addictive, and highly rewarding at the same time. </p>

			<p>Where and when I winsurf Depends on the season and weather. I can be in the Balboa Shores during the summer to catch the San Pedro's winds, or I can be in lakes in the spring. The santa Ana's usually are a big season for windsurfers in the southern sky. California lakes are a great place for some great slaloms during fall and winter. I've tried to ride and chase famous big waves, but that was pushing the envolope for me. One Day!</p>
